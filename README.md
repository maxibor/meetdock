## Introduction

This Protein-Protein docking method was developped for the [Meet-U competition](http://meet-u.org/).
A sampling method was selected from one of the participating sampling teams, while we developped our own scoring method, using the followings:  

- Checking for shape complementarity and steric clashes.
- Knowledge based scoring on amino-acids interactions.
- Electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions scoring.
- Adjusting the weights of the different scoring functions by machine learning.

## Dependancies

- [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/)

## Download

#### 1- download the latest release of MeetDock [here](https://github.com/meetU-MasterStudents/2017-2018_Equipe1/releases/latest)

#### 2- decompress the `.zip` file

`unzip 2017-2018_Equipe1-*`

#### 3- go to MeetDockOne folder

`cd 2017-2018_Equipe1-*`

## Installation

### A- Environment - Conda

To ensure the cross-platform reproducibility of this method, we choose to work with a [conda](https://conda.io) environment.

The environment file is available here as [environment.yml](./environment.yml).

#### 1- create the environment from the environment.yml file

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

#### 2- activate the environment

`source activate meetu`

#### 3- solvant accessible surface (optional)

The default method to compute the solvant accessible surface is [msms](http://mgltools.scripps.edu/packages/MSMS).  
However, it is **really slow** and will **not work for big complexes, but it will run out of the box** and is included in *MeetDockOne*.  

To solve this issue, it is also possible to run *MeetDockOne* with [Naccess](http://wolf.bms.umist.ac.uk/naccess/) (see Documentation section of this readme), a faster and more reliable method.  
To do so, you will first need to install Naccess yourself.

The compilation of Naccess requires a Fortran compiler.

**Ubuntu/Debian Linux**
- `sudo apt-get install gfortran`  
- `csh lib/NACCESS/install.scr`  
- `cp lib/NACCESS/* /usr/local/bin`  

**OS X**
- Download and install the fortran compiler for your system [here](https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries#MacOS)
- `csh lib/NACCESS/macinstall.scr`
- `cp lib/NACCESS/* /usr/local/bin`  

## Our two programs

There are two programs you can use from the root directory of the project

#### `meetdock` : meetdock is our scoring-only program for the other teams.
#### `meetdockAZ` : meetdockAZ is our full program that includes the work of team sampling n°6 and our scoring.

## Quick start with meetdockAZ

meetdockAZ is our full implementation from sampling to scoring.

Just type

```
(meetu)$ python meetdockAZ.py
```

The program will then ask you if you want to run a demo on a preconfigured ligand+receptor (without minimizer) and very little amount of ligand rotations

If you say no, then it will ask you to manually specify your inputs (receptor, chain, outputdir, minimizer, nb of rotations)

#### Default output

- By default, output is in ./out/

## Quick start with meetdock
```
(meetu)$ ./meetdock  path/to/meetdock/data -recChain A -ligChain B  -shape -electro -jones -proba
```
- The dictory `path/to/meetdockone/data` contains pdb complexes to score.  
- The receptor is Chain A (`-recChain A`).  
- The ligand is Chain B (`-LigChain B`).  
- The following methods will be computed on the complexes :    
    - shape complementarity (`-shape`)
    - electrostatic energy (``-electro`)
    - Leenard-Jones interactions  (`-jones`)
    - A knowledge based scoring function (`-proba`)


## Output

- `MeetDockOne_results.csv`: a .csv file summarizing your results, sorted by decreasing predicted Tm score.
    - **pdb**: name of the pdb file
    - **electrostatic**: Electrostatic energy
    - **shape**: Shape complementarity, similar to [Chen et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/prot.10092)
    - **vdw**: Van der Waals interactions
    - **tm_score_prediction**: Predicted Tm score with our Machine learning model
    - **interpretations**: Tm score > 0.8 Excellent || 0.8 > Tm score >= 0.6 Moyen || 0.6 > Tm score >= 0.4 Passable || 0.4 > Tm score mauvais
